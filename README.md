simpleCanvasTexture
===================

just a simple wrapper of a javascript based HTML Canvas texturing demo written by [unconed](http://acko.net/blog/projective-texturing-with-canvas/)

## Introduction

The original motivation of writting this snippet is that Javascript based HTML Canvas texturing would provide a truely pragmatic cross-platform solution for supporting 3D-like effects on most modern browsers (even in IE6,7,8 with some help of [FlashCanvas](http://flashcanvas.net/)).

However,there are lots of improvements need to be made.
