simpleCanvasTexture
===================

just a simple wrapper of a javascript based HTML Canvas texturing demo from [unconed](http://acko.net/blog/projective-texturing-with-canvas/)

## Introduction

The original motivation of writting this snippet is that Javascript based HTML Canvas texturing would provide a truely pragmatic cross-platform solution for supporting 3D-like effects on most modern browsers (even in IE6,7,8 with some help of [FlashCanvas](http://flashcanvas.net/)).

This wrapper just provides several APIs for creating HTML5 Canvas Elements and making basic transformation effects.

However,there are still lots of improvements need to be made.
